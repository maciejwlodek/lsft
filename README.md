**lsft.sage**

A SageMath project for computing the commutative LSFT algebra of a Legendrian knot (see 'Lenhard Ng. Rational Symplectic Field Theory for Legendrian Knots. Invent. Math., 182(3):451â€“512, 2010.') as well as the bordered LSFT algebras of Legendrian tangles (see 'Maciej Wlodek. Bordered Legendrian Rational Symplectic Field Theory.'  [in preparation]). 
Relies on lch.sage, slightly modified from 'https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~ssivek/code/lch.sage' (used with permission; acknowledgments to Steven Sivek).

Load order: lch.sage, then lsft.sage, then blsft.sage.
